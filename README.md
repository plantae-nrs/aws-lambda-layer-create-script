## Build Machine Learning Layers for Python Lambda functions with 10 lines of code

### Introduction
This repository will introduce a simple way to create layers for Lambda in Python. Although this uses the example of ```sklearn```, which is a package for machine learning, you will learn how to build any python layer using the files provided here. Once this layer is created, you can use the layer to host your own models on lambda for inference or prediction. Although this post is specific to building machine learning specific layers, you can use the same procedure to create any python layer that is compatible with lambda, as long as the additional packages you need can be installed with pip. Let’s get started!

### Steps

First, create a shell script (.sh file) with the following code (or use the one in this repository):

```html
#!/bin/bash

CURRENT=`pwd`

if [ "$1" != "" ] || [$# -gt 1]; then
	echo "Creating layer compatible with python version $1"
	docker run -v "$PWD":/var/task "lambci/lambda:build-python$1" /bin/sh -c "pip install -r requirements.txt -t python/lib/python$1/site-packages/; exit"

	# Clean unused stuff
	cd "python/lib/python$1/site-packages/"
	rm -rf easy-install*
	rm -rf wheel*
	rm -rf setuptools*
	rm -rf virtualenv*
	rm -rf pip*
	find . -type d -name "tests" -exec rm -rf {} +
	find . -type d -name "test" -exec rm -rf {} +
	find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
	find . -name '*.pyc' -delete
	echo "Final layer size: $(du -sh . | cut -f1)"
	cd "$CURRENT"
	zip -r layer.zip python > /dev/null
	rm -r python
	echo "Done creating layer!"
	ls -lah layer.zip

else
	echo "Enter python version as argument - ./createlayer.sh 3.6"
fi

```

Name the file “createlayer.sh” and save it. The scripts requires an argument for the python version that you want to use for the layer; the script checks for this argument and requires the following:

1.	Docker should be installed: https://docs.docker.com/install/. If you are using a local machine, and EC2 instance or a laptop, you will need to install docker. When using an Amazon Sagemaker notebook instance terminal window, or a AWS Cloud9 terminal, docker will already be installed. 
2.	A requirements.txt file that is in the same path as the “createlayer.sh” script that you created above, that has the packages that you need to install.  Refer to this documentation on creating requireemnts files https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/requirements.html


For this sklearn example, our requirements.txt file will look like this:
```html
scikit-learn
```

Add any other packages you may need, with version numbers with one package name per line. 

Next, make sure that your createlayer.sh script is executable; on linux or Mac OS terminal window, navigate to where you saved the createlayer.sh file and type in:

```html
chmod +x createlayer.sh
```

Now you are ready to create a layer. In the terminal, type:

```html
./createlayer.sh 3.6
```

This will pull the container that matches the lambda runtime (this ensures that your layer is compatible by default), creates the layer using packages specified in the requirements.txt file, and then saves a layer.zip that you can then upload to a Lambda function using instructions here - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/working-with-aws-lambda-and-lambda-layers-in-aws-sam/ 

Example logs when running this script to create a Lambda-compatible sklearn layer is shown below:

```html

```

The script outputs the size of the zipped layer as shown above (60MB). Make sure you read the guidelines on limits published here - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html

Once finished note the packges installed and *ONLY* add required dependancies to requirements.txt. For example: since scipy and numpy are provided by AWS layer - they should be included in requirements.txt.

Modify createlayer.sh, add `--no-deps` to the pip install so it will look as such:
`docker run -v "$PWD":/var/task "lambci/lambda:build-python$1" /bin/sh -c "pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt -t python/lib/python$1/site-packages/; exit"`

Rerun `createlayer.sh`

Any layer(.zip) above 10MB in size must be uploaded to S3 first so you can provide AWS Lambda with a link to the layer on S3, and layers less than 10MB can be uploaded directly through the AWS lambda console. Each function can have up to 5 layers, and the total size of all unzipped layers and code must be less than 250 MB. 

Use the same script to generate the layers you would like to use, for example – sagemaker, mxnet, onnx, pillow, tensorflow-lite, or Deep learning runtime (DLR, https://pypi.org/project/dlr/) to host your Machine Learning models on Lambda!
